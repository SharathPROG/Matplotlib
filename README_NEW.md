In the Final Project, I am going to Learn the Basics of using Pandas Dataframe and to create static Visualization with Matplotlib libraries/modules
I will be first learning and then implementing new project based on the pandas data frame and plotting it in different graphs using matplotlib.

The main objective for the project will be Learning the Basics of Pandas Dataframe(How to create, various components of Dataframe, properties, and various methods associated with it), basics of NumPy , basics of matplotlib (how to create various graphs, plot it and save it, various methods). The final task will be to download and use MIT Election data from https://electionlab.mit.edu/data in CSV format and use pandas to read the data, get the data in the required data frame using pandas. and now with the help of matplit lib we will plot different charts/graphs - bar chart, pie chart, etc.
